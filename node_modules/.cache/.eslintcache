The entire problem was formulated<br/>\r\n        as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. I also made an intuitive interface for the solution<br/>\r\n        using matplotlib animations in Python. This experience tested some of the mathematics concepts I never thought <br/>\r\n        I would get to apply. It was challenging at first but being able to correlate some solving methods and geometrical<br/>\r\n        solutions into the path-planning domain definitely helped me grow as a roboticist.</p>\r\n       <h2>My time at Analog Devices</h2>\r\n      <p>Before arriving for my Master's, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Analog Devices, India or ADI.<br/> \r\n       ADI was working on a Time-of-Flight sensor and the team I was interning with was selected to present  <br/>\r\n       their idea at the global ADI GTC that happened in March 2023.</p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I worked on making a simulation for my team using Robot Operating System and Gazebo Simulator.<br/>\r\n        The simulation was of a 4-wheel skid-steer drive that streamed sensor data in a C++ script using<br/>\r\n        ROStopics. I got to learn about modelling the physics of a physically realizable system while making this<br/>\r\n        simulation. The package that I created was added as a meta-package to the main codebase. \r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>ADI planned to port their current sensor into the Robot Operating System-2 environment, for which<br/>\r\n       they needed to check for vulnerabilities. I found this to be a very good way to dip my feet into ROS-2.<br/>\r\n       I wrote a script in C++ using OpenCV to transfer messages from one ROS-2 system instance to another, the <br/>\r\n       existing system faced a lot of latency while receiving images and I helped improve it by reducing the<br/> \r\n       latency to about 67%. Working on something that was useful to the company felt empowering and motivating to me.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>My time as an Undergraduate Researcher</h2>\r\n    <p>I was an undergraduate research intern at Ontario Tech University under the guidance of Dr. Scott Nokleby<br/>\r\n      in the <a href=\"http://mars.engineering.uoit.ca/\" style={{ fontSize: '20px',display: 'inline', textDecoration: 'underline' }} target=\"blank\">Mechatronic and Robotic Systems Laboratory (MARS Lab)</a>\r\n       This experience was a research fellowship<br/> award to me by MITACS. The prompt of the project was to work on\r\n       an autonomous wheelchair for children<br/> with disabilities like cerebral palsy. This was an experience that taught\r\n       me a lot about the importance of <br/>software architecture for autonomous robots and how to conduct research. <br/>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I worked on the D435i depth-camera by Intel for localization and to detect obstacles. One of the requirement<br/>\r\n        was that slopes lower than a 15 degree incline should be traversable and not be treated like an obstalce. To<br/>\r\n        solve this I first ventured into computer vision, I developed a methodology and implemented a python script <br/>calculated the slope of\r\n        obstalces in front of the camera. Although, like many things I didn't get an accuracy of <br/>slope estimation that\r\n        would let me call the task complete. So, after researching I narrowed down the likely cause<br/> to noise from the \r\n        camera and implemented a moving-average filter to help improve the accuracy to 98%.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The main part of the project was designing the software architecture and implementation to make autonomous <br/>\r\n        navigation successful. We decided to implement an algorithm called RRT* (Optimized Rapidly Exploring Random Trees)<br/>\r\n        to perform navigation within the map. To avoid collision from unknown obstacles that aren't in the map but can exist<br/>\r\n        (Eg. Trolleys or Humans walking around), we implemented a local planner using a Proportional-Derivative controller<br/>\r\n        modelling the error function in such a way that it produces a controller effort that is inversely-porportional to<br/>\r\n        the distance from the detected obstacle. \r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        We also used a Turtlebot-3 Burger robot based on Raspberry Pi 4 and OpenCR to test the entire setup on hardware<br/> and were able to see that the algorithms\r\n        worked successfully.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>My time working at a UAV startup</h2>\r\n      <p>In my 2nd year of college I got the opportunity to work at AEREO (Formerly Aarav Unmanned Systems). I got to work<br/>\r\n      path-planning for Unammned Aerial Vehicles and autonomating testing procedures for them. I got exposure to open-source<br/>\r\n      Frameworks and developing on top of an existing codebase. I got familiar with the Ardupilot flight-stack and worked on <br/>\r\n      creating a Software-In-Loop testbench that was later integrated to a Ground Control Software using TCP and UDP. <br/>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>My time working in Project MANAS</h2>\r\n      <p>During my undergraduate degree I was part of Project MANAS, the robotics student project of MIT Manipal. During <br/>\r\n      2021-2022 I led the automation front of the team for AUVSI SUAS 2022 and a driverless car for the Mahindra Rize Prize<br/>\r\n      Challenge. I got to work hands on with a lot of sensor modules and communication protocols like I2C, UART, SPI, CAN   <br/>\r\n      for autonomous robots. I worked quite a bit on the lateral controller of a driverless car and helped implement a <br/>\r\n      modified Stanley Controller with feedforward for lane centering.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>My time working for MBZIRC</h2>\r\n      <p>I was part of Team Luna, representing India among the top 13 teams internationally as semi-finalists for the Mohamed <br/>\r\n       Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC). I worked on Forward and Inverse Kinematics of 6-axis <br/>\r\n      robotic arm on top of a surface vehicle as part of the competition prompt. <br/>\r\n      \r\n      </p>\r\n      <hr/>\r\n      <h1>What's next</h1>\r\n      <p>I'm going to be working at Applied Material as a Software Engineering Intern this summer!
